This is a proof of concept prepared for Quandoo.

The task I was assigned to involved automation of sample web application.

I decided to use modern and popular stack and develop my own framework following the Page Object Model and all good practices.
Following technologies and tools have been used:

_Java
_Maven
_TestNG
_Cucumber

All required dependencies are already there for you in pom.xml file

<b>How to run the tests:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Clone this repo to your local directory</li>
    <li>Make sure that Java8 and Maven are installed on your machine</li>
    <li>Open terminal and type: mvn compile</li>
    <li>Now you can fire up tests with: mvn test</li>
</ul>

Remember to collect great reports that are available locally in:
<i>target/cucumber-reports/advanced-reports</i>

or simple one:

<i>target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-pretty/index.html</i>


~ Enjoy!
